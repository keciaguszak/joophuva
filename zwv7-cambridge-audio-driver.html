                            <p>Cambridge Audio is a British manufacturer of high-end audio equipment. As the name suggests, it has its origins in Cambridge, England where in the early 1960s a group of young technology graduates established a high technology RD and prototyping business: Cambridge Consultants.  The Cambridge Audio DacMagic Plus is an inexpensive, lightweight, Chinese-made DAC with astounding performance. It has the highest performance of any DAC I've ever measured, and is among the least expensive. Right so I just finished my practical for my AS IT, which was a re-sit. The reason why I had to re-sit was cause basically the theory part didn't go very well last year and it dropped my grade by a shit ton. Since it's Cambridge, I can't just re-do my theory paper; I have to do all of it. Anyways, this exam was a fucking mess. For me, the Cambridge examination board is just insane. The practical exam is 90 marks. AND THERE WAS ONE SINGULAR QUESTION WORTH 45 MARKS. That's half of my fucking. 
Cambridge Audio’s Azur 840C CD player made quite a splash back in 2007. In my review of that device (Issue 174, September, 2007) I was shocked not only by the advanced technologies and build-quality of this 99 player, but more importantly by how good it sounded. The 840C, I concluded Hey guys, I'm a beginner when it comes to this stuff, so I'm hoping for some help, if possible. I'll go straight to the point: I currently own an Audio-Technica AT-LP120USBHC, and I'm looking for an amplifier and two passive speakers to pair it with. I've gotten a lot of help from the user sharkamino, and I've narrowed it down to a few choices, but I'd like to hear about which of these should I go for and why: Speakers: 1.

I’ve been exposed to and appreciated nicer equipment my entire life, but only recently was in a position to invest some $$ into it. I read the reviews, the blogs, and the websites for a few years before Rated 5 out of 5 by ColinRC21 from A solid well made product. I have Cambridge audio equipment already , AZUR 651, with which I am very pleased. This Sound Bar is a perfect addition to my Panasonic flat screen.

Okay, everyone. Strap in. This is going to be long  After 8 1/2 hours of measurements, and over 6 hours of analysis, and writing, I finally ran out of wine. --------------- ## Tl;Dr: ~~I am speechless. The HomePod actually sounds better than the KEF X300A. If you’re new to the Audiophile world, KEF is a very well respected and much loved speaker company. I actually deleted my very first measurements and re-checked everything because they were so good, I thought I’d made an error.

I am a long time Altec Lansing enthusiast and am fortunate enough to have been exposed to some exquisitely made setups over the years. A7X’s modified to get into high 40hz response, A5s with 288 multi cell horns and the like. Systems that can induce an involuntary release of ones bowels.

A driver diagram is a visual display of a team’s theory of what “drives,” or contributes to, the achievement of a project aim.

Would like to find homes for these two. Note that there are issues with the HD 580. amp#x200B; HD 580 - Left driver is weird. Sounds perfectly fine a low and normal volumes, even high volume if there isn't much bass. However, lower frequencies cause some rattling/vibrations/something past low/moderate volumes. I took them apart to see if I could find a hair or something rattling on the driver cone but I didn't see anything. Maybe you know more than I do and can fix it. Maybe the driver Ok, for the past 6 months, this 5 gpu rig has been running fine. Now, it suddenly refuses to mine when a 5th card is hooked up, but 4 cards or less is no issue. Whenever a 5th card was hooked up, the OS would lock up every few seconds then unfreeze. In Task Manager, you can see the system process taking up about 20% of my celeron's cpu. When I uninstall the GPU drivers, the above does not occur. When I reinstall them, the locking up behavior comes back. I've tried the blockchain. gt What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. Mainly work (Linux) and some gaming (Windows). My Linux setup is very resource-light, so while the gaming is secondary, it's the main driver for the hardware. Vast majority of games will be 5+ years old; most resource-heavy games I \ currently\ own are probably Wolfenstein II and Witcher 3 though I wouldn't mind being able to handle some newer games (2017 I prefer neutral sound, but I know that's not what closed back are best at. Would be tempted for something with slightly enhanced bass, as my current sets are slightly bass lacking. Not too bothered about wireless or noise canceling, would prefer higher sound quality. For use possibly on flights (although I usually use etymotic IEMs which block sound out well) and in the office, when open back aren't very appropriate. Price limit 0 but the lower the better! Currently own: HD414(600omhs). When i connect my iPhone SE and iPad (2016) to my computer with Bluetooth i get a message: \ device name\ is not supported (both on iOS 11.4.1). I have a generic Bluetooth stick from Cambridge Silicon Radio Ltd and another one named Asus BT400. From pc to iPhone i can pair them together with a code but afterwards they are not connected. if i connect them manually i get the same message as before. However connecting and paring does work for my Philips headphone and a JBL speaker, so the proble. Note to MODS : Don't touch this thread. News and info is needed to keep people safe.

Hi all, Newbie here from r/budgetaudiophile. I’ve come across a post in r/diy about speaker building. I also follow kitbymeetsaudio on YouTube and find it very interesting. So, I’m remodeling my living room, I’m making a media cabinet what will be 8’x8’ I got a deal with my girlfriend that I can buy speaker as long as they’re pretty. First I wanted to have bookshelf’s, but people advices me that towers were often more powerful and more room filling. I will mainly use them for tv, movie. ## UPCOMING SHOWS: 07/16-08/16 (https://bostonhassle.com/chosen-shows/category/hassle-shows/) Art Show at the Dorchester Art Project: Altarations: A Selection of Shrines (https://dorchesterartproject.org/) gtcoming Soon #July Tues 07/17 gosh! + the water cycle + mint green (https://bostonhassle.com/event/gosh-the-water-cycle-mint-green/) @ Dorchester Art Proejct, 8-11:30pm, All Ages,  gtThis night of shimmering indie pop will pluck on your heartstrings Hello all, The wife and I recently bought our first house, and I'm looking to upgrade/optimize my 10+ year old audio setup that I've had since college. Apologies if this post is breaking any rules of this sub. I'll certainly read up on my own as well, but I'm Jon Snow when it comes to home audio and I thought I'd just ask for some advice on setup and what to upgrade with a budget of about 0. My living room layout with photos (https://imgur.com/a/ATUgXX2) Goal: upgrade my setup Title: Kanata’s past This year’s spring has a hint of summer Page 1 The ghost town is swallowing up the row of cars one at a time!! Cars no. 3 and 2 are disappearing into the fog Page 2 It’s hard for me to give live updates on the situation. The footage being sent to us by the drone is blurred, making it difficult to see what’s happening. I apologize if there are any issues with the audio in this area. The Yajikita siblings are moving as one unit together (Pardon for the wall of text, TL;DR at the bottom.) Just like the title says, I'm looking for a pair of IEMs to use on the road (and at home) with good noise isolation. I travel by bus and train frequently, and fly every so often. Being able to block out noisy colleagues would be a nice bonus. Budget : anywhere up to 200 euro's, but I value a good performance/price-ratio. So I can stretch my budget if needed. Availability : must be able to buy the gear from a place that ships Pics here (https://imgur.com/a/zraEt) I’d looked at these at full price before, but held off due to lack of reliable reviews. These were recently on sale for /pair with free shipping, and I bought four pairs on impulse. 2.5 pairs are either a permanent or temporary replacement for a Q Acoustics 5.1 setup that I really grew to dislike. The last pair were for office use if they turned out to be good, or to hack and mod if they sucked. Little risk involved at this price. I don’t normally. Been playing with my 55XE9305 / X930E for a few weeks now so thought I'd post up my thoughts as I know a lot of people ask about the comparison between this and the LG OLED. My OLED blew up after a day, and I was generally underwhelmed with it so after doing a lot of research I went with the Sony. Picture Quality I generally keep things pretty simple and don't spend hours running calibrations. I have an open, usually fairly bright living room so using "Standard" works best for me, Motionf.

So my house has an in-ceiling system that was installed before I moved in, that I would like to simplify a bit on the control end. It consists of: - 2x (ceiling mounted) Cambridge Audio Ambience 80 10-125w Drivers ( - (ceiling mounted) mystery model 50hz Crystal Audio 12" subwoofer with separate wall power. (https://photos.app.goo.gl/Vzys4RyB86aMnGjf1) This would all be fine, but the component I'm getting a Pioneer VSX531 (https://www.richersounds.com/tv-home-cinema/av-receivers/pioneer-vsx531-black-sos.html) however I'm stuck on what to pair it with. I'm on a budget of £300, so that leaves £120 to play with, even less would be preferable. I narrowed it down to a few options which look alright: Q Acoustics 2010i (https://www.richersounds.com/hi-fi/standmount-speakers/q-acoustics-2010i-graph-pr.html) - Cheapest of them all. Look nice enough and have good reviews. Little concerned. </p>

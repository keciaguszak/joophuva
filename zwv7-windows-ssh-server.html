                            <p> I just managed to get an SSH server running at home with Windows 10. I can already tell it's going to be different from Linux, but in trying to keep this server secure, where would I find the auth.log file (or any config files for that matter). Anybody have any recommendations for a good Windows 10 SSH Server. I'm currently using FileZilla server for FTPS but would like to switch to SFTP. Can anyone recommend a good SSH server for windows? So far I've tried Bitvise SSH Server (https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-server) and loved it's ease of use and it's console and RDP features. But I need something like FileZilla server that has granular control of permissions on the user folders. Thanks in advance! Edit: Went with Bitvise. The Standard version that integrates with AD is really awesome. Extremely. Wondering if anyone has used this before, and if you trust the source code. I'm not much of a coder so I don't trust myself to check the source for phone-home things. Here's the link: ninja edit : here's the changelog: http://www.kpym.com/2/kpym/changes.txt. Hello homelab village! I could really use some help. My lab is young and I am trying to connect to it remotely (and securely). I set up an open ssh server on my windows 2012 server essentials. I followed a guide to ensure I created keys, enabled local firewall rules, and started the service. I also made a port forwarding rule on my router to forward traffic on port 22 to my server. I am getting a timeout and I am not sure why. Does anyone have any advice or resources 
With all the awesomeness of OpenSSH for Windows being included as a native Windows feature in 1803 and later, it's become harder to find any relevant information on OpenSSH on older versions of Windows Server. I'm working with a Windows Server 2016 box, and we now have a use case where we'd like to run an SSH command on a remote server as part of a task workflow. Basically right now, a scheduled task runs that executes a PowerShell script. I want to add a command to that script Hi everyone! A bit delayed on today's post because I just had to go wander around in NYC. Why wouldn't you, if you don't actually live here? Today's post is about SSH in Windows Server 2019. Yes, I know it's not available to download yet, but we have a post about how you can utilize new features when you get to play with it. Article Link: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askpfeplat/2018/10/29/ssh-on-windows-server-2019/ > # SSH on Windows Server 2019 > Hello all from PFE Land!. Hello, I've been trying to create a script to use during deployment with MDT, which should install OpenSSH Server and set the default shell to PowerShell. When testing I get an error of "Cannot find any service with service name 'sshd'." But when I run the script manually it runs through with no errors or warnings and everything works as expected. I'm not quite sure where the issue lays, I'm thinking of breaking the script up so I can restart the OS and then configure the default shell. I have a W10 machine with bash set up. If a open a cmd window and type "bash -i" I can get put in a bash shell no problem. However, if I enter the W10 machine using psexec and the same user and type bash -i, everything just hangs. I know I can and do use an ssh server to get in, but I can only do that if the Ubuntu ssh server is running. It is not always running. I thought I could use the psexec entry as a backup and start the ubuntu ssh server or do anything else, but from the psexec. Hey everyone, So I'm not really at everyone's level here but I'm thinking this is the best sub to inquire on. I currently run a CentOS 7 server. It is headless and I connect via TeamViewer. I found a script online that ran TeamViewer on startup so this allowed me to remotely control my server anywhere including after reboots. I use the server to run a few game servers, some file storage, and might get into using it for media/Kodi type setups once I have a TV. Pretty basic and amateur stuff. While messing around with the new WSL I found that I wasn't able to get the ssh server working, yet I was still able to SSH into the machine. Most of the problem was that port 22 was already being used by another process. I found that if I killed the two SSH services in Windows (SSH Server Broker and SSH Server Proxy) that port 22 appeared to open. Another weird thing was that when I did SSH into Windows, it went straight to the command line, and I got an error every time I tried I almost did that myself, but luckily Windows doesn't respond to `sudo shutdown Operating system Ubuntu 18.04 kernel 5.0.0 amd gpu, ryzen 2700x cpu, wired network connection I'm trying to set up a headless windows PC without the benefit of having access to windows remote desktop using Remmina. I don't know how to get my linux/ubuntu computer to see my home network, though, and I cant find a decent guide to this on the internet( most are from the windows perspective, trying to hook up to a linux pc.) I do have the advantage of access and control Since I don't know of a good/quick way to SSH into a large/changing set of known remote servers, I created a bunch of .bat files that literally only contain the following: wsl ssh user@host For me, this is easy because every time I have a new server to connect to, all I have to do is make a copy of the file, change the host, and I'm done. I know I could use PuTTY, but doing it this way works well for me. Anyway, I'll walk away from my desk for a bit and the WSL window 
I have always used Windows for RoR development but I'm getting tired of the workarounds required for certain things (when it works at all) so decided to use the subsystem and ubuntu. What are some of the things I should be aware of moving environments/working on the subsystem linux environment? I'm a fairly experienced developer but it has always been on Windows. Will transitioning be difficult? is it vastly different working in linux than windows? I'm including how I setup Hey everyone, I'm trying to get SSH working on Windows Server Core 2016. I have a few servers running just core and I'd love to be able to SSH to them over my VPN and issue commands because RDPing can be a PITA. That being said, I was able to follow the directions and get OpenSSH working on my Hyper-V Machine (has full desktop) without a problem from here: https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH (https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Inst. I have a W10 machine with bash set up. If a open a cmd window and type "bash -i" I can get to a bash shell no problem. However, if I enter the W10 machine using psexec and the same user and type bash -i, everything just hangs. I know I can and do use an Ubuntu ssh server to get in, but I can only do that if the Ubuntu ssh server is running. It only seems to run if there is at least one bash session active. I thought I could use the psexec entry as a backup and start the ubuntu ssh server How to make the process of ssh login more effective, convenient and faster? It is not an issue when you have 7-10 servers but if you have a llot of them especially distributed all over the world - it becomes a mess!! Guys please advice thank. Hey all, I've always wondered what people thought was better: VMWare ESXi or Proxmox with regards to virtualization? For example, imagine you had: 10x ESXi servers (free license) Each server had 10x VMs (split between Win and Linux) Had a need for fast deployment Easiest way to monitor / admin Lowest budget possible Is there a reason that ESXi or Proxmox is better than one another? As somebody who has used ESXi for ages, I've often found it wanting in a great many areas I'm not a real linux admin, but I run several Linux servers at work and home (CentOS/Debian). I use ssh tunnels to forward ports from my dedicated ssh server into other parts of my networks. It's a thing of beauty :D Also, I'm really glad that M$ finally has an OpenSSH client (and WSL!) 'built in' to the OS, since we're mostly a Windows shop at work. PuTTY was great, but there's nothing quite Hi all, So recently I've installed Ubuntu v18.04 LTS on my laptop and I'm loving it definately different to windows, anyway the only issue I'm having is setting up my Windows Workgroup Network. I followed this YouTube video and the only issue I have is when I click on Windows Network it is showing up as empty. https://youtu.be/QcpkGMua6Cg Is there something I'm missing? Cheers.

With the recent upgrade to Windows 10, Microsoft fixed many of the things that I despised in Windows 8. I don't usually use Windows if I can avoid I've went through the excellent guide provided by Tim Davis which is about configuring Git to work with SSH under Windows in order to produce a Git Server in order. </p>

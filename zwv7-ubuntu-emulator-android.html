                            <p> The Android Emulator can use hardware acceleration features to improve performance, sometimes drastically. This page describes how you can configure graphics and virtual machine (VM) acceleration to get higher performance from the emulator. If you do any Android development in Ubuntu it is much better to test your applications on a real device rather than just relying on the emulator.

Hey Guys, as you know the Smartphone market is dominated by Android OS – which itself is an operating system designed / based on the linux kernel , but unfortunately the Android Emulators for Linux itself are quite less as compared to windows counterparts 🙁  so let’s have a look on the 5 best Android Emulators for Linux to run android apps and play android games on Linux -Ubuntu. Am having a problem installing bluestacks on ubuntu 18.04 using wine,someone to help please with the procedure. I recently tested a prototype of a Xamarin Android app that should run on Android 4.1+. So I fired up Visual Studio Emulator for Android and saw that API level 16 (4.1) is missing Nox App Player. Nox Player especially targets Android gamers. Although the emulator works perfectly fine for other Android apps and enjoying the whole Android experience, it is best suited. I installed Anbox, but it doesn't seem to start even after a complete reinstall, it just gets to the splash screen, hangs for about 90 secons then crashes out, the terminal reads: amp#x200B; \ daemon.cpp:61@Run\ Application manager service is not running yet amp#x200B; If I try to launch the Application Manager from the terminal it says that /usr/share/libdrm/amdgpu.ids: no such file or directory and crashes out with the above error. amp#x200B; I have everything I could Download WindowsAndroid 4.0.3. Emulating Android on Windows has never been so easy. WindowsAndroid is an Android emulator for Windows that allows you to run a virtual machine with the Android operating system, from which you can perform any activity that you normally would on a smartphone running. I'm trying to find a good android emulator I could use on Linux. I'm considering making the switch from windows but I'd like to know if there's any bluestacks-like alternative. I realized alot of my streaming/media apps are sideloaded and run natively in bluestacks. I've tried anbox in both virtual machines and hard disk installed systems but both fail to boot, they hang at the start screen. I was open to remix os and android x86 but x86 has been slow for me and remix os has absolutely. 
Not trying to make this a Windows vs Linux argument but for some reason it's either the Linux version of Android Studio/Java or Linux itself that is just horrible with memory and resource management for some reason it will let itself utilize like 99 to 100% of the system resources which makes no sense because then the OS locks. On Windows Android studio I have never had an issue with it literally locking up the OS it throttles itself appropriately? The main problem is after running building. So, recently I became kind of interested in developing for Android using Android Studio. But there is a problem: on Windows, it only supports Intel's CPU virtualization, while on Linux it can use my AMD's virtualization (and without this thing enabled, it becomes an incredible pain to emulate). I also was thinking about moving to Linux as my main OS as Windows seems to be kinda messy and big on installing features I don't need, and even though I can still bash all of those down, it becomes annoy. So I am searching for a good Android Emulator on Ubuntu and thought you guys could give me some suggestions. Giving Linux's ability to mold into a near infinite amount of distros with completely different uses and interfaces, I wonder if anybody has ever mistaken a Linux based distro for a Mac OS X or Windows system. I've heard of less "literate" people mistaking their OS's but what about you LMR'ers? My younger brother was given (well bought with a massive discount) a tiny laptop, by a Gov. program to equip every kid with a basic PC for school. It had Windows XP and a locally made Linux distro "caixa. 
I'm trying to launch an AVD and getting an error message ( The console at the bottom seems to just have the same message but with a little more info so I'm including that ( too. I did install the 32-bit libraries needed to run Android Studio on 64-bit Linux machines. I'm running the newest version of Android Studio on Kubuntu 16.04. I'm also getting the same problem on my desktop. Though its error ( messages (http. Pretty much the title. What libraries, software, tools, guides, etc do you use in your environment and why do you use those over others. Sorry for the yoda-esque question. Last time I tried to run Android Studio on Linux, (Debian) I had a lot of problems. The IDE ran but a lot of red errors. Somethings missing. On Windows though, it was no problem. Point and click. Seeing as I will be using Linux for a while, and still would like to use Android Studio. I've heard Linux Mint is a good Linux distro to use with AS. What are your thoughts? Also my computer is old, singe core, 4 gigs of ram. I wonder if I won't Okay, say you had an Android phone with an unlocked boot loader. Couldn't you install an ARM Linux distro on it and run that native on your phone with a keyboard and mouse? Or maybe you had a phone with an Intel mobile processor, like the Asus Zenfone 2. Couldn't you install any X86 Linux distro and install X86 apps, like Steam and GIMP and Wine and all of that? Then, say you had some beastly, awesome, amazing phone with an X86 processor, some massive battery, a big like 5.5 inch screen I'm building a new PC right now and I'm going to be running win 10 for gaming and MS Office and stuff but I'll also be running a Linux flavor for all my development work. Which is your preferred distro for Android Dev and development in general. Will it work or will I enter a limbo. 
I just came back from the Big Android BBQ and I noticed that everyone had Apple laptops. One person had a Surface. I'm not a noob about software and operating systems. I've installed and used Linux mint numerous times, and I've done some ROM building just building, not coding). Mainly I want to know which OS and why, for dev work (which includes design work as an indie dev). Windows is what I'm most comfortable with. I can handle a bash shell pretty well. I think I could make my pc a hackin. Has someone here tried Ubuntu for phones? I'd really like to read some thoughts The Android Emulator can use hardware acceleration features to improve performance, sometimes drastically. This page describes how you can configure graphics. 
I tried to launch application in emulator in android Studio in ubuntu 14.04 and it shows the following errors. Error shown while gradle build is in process.
